# dart-kickstart

going through google kick start problems to learn dart


## why?

starting to fall in love with this language. it takes the best parts of 
python, js and cpp and crammed them all together with really nice developer tooling into a statically compiled language that runs literally everywhere. 

Similarities:
* JS: Has very similar helper functions for built-in types as javascript, and treats functions as first class objects. higher order functions behave pretty much exactly the same. 
* Python: The design philosophy both seemed tied to make writing the language as easy as possible. It feels like all the syntax was made to write as little as possible, and the string methods feel really good.
* C++: The language is statically typed and seems to be designed from the ground up around classes. It also has support for generics. Additionally, dart even has garbage collection, so I guess a better comparision would be to Java.

Developer Experience (dx):
* Oh my gosh. The dart extension for vscode seems second to none. Haven't seen anything this nice in a while.
* Formatter, package manager, and analyzer are all already built in just by installing. WTF?

Speed
Unsure?
